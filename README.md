“To grow is a garden's worth.” — Jim Grey, Caligula's Horse

I am a former teacher who decided to learn coding. Learning is what I am most passionate about in my life, and I full-heartedly believe that I made the best choice when picking coding as my next challenge. I instantly fell in love with the idea of working in programming, as it is an ever evolving field where there is constantly more to learn and new ways to grow. 

<!-- I have recently graduated from the Virginia Tech Coding Bootcamp powered by Fullstack Academy. While I still fully intend to continue learning independently, I am now looking for my place in the field. My goal is to utilize my newfound programming skills while also leveraging the skills I developed in the multifaceted and demanding education environment. -->
